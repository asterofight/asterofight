	<h1>Astero Fight - Join us!</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Free MMO space shooter by <a href="credits.html">many of us</a></p>
	<p>Come and join the team to make the game better! We need you if you find any of the following open topics
		interesting and can work on it.</p>
	<p>
		You can join the team by applying to the university project lab Asterofight at Budapest University of Technology
		and Economics, Department of Automation and Applied Informatics;
		or if not a student then by sending an email to <a href="mailto:asterofight@outlook.com?Subject=Application">asterofight@outlook.com</a>.
		Mention which topic you like the most.

		<h2>Particle System</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">Programming - JavaScript (TypeScript)</p>
		<p>
			The game server sends effect information to the client like explosions, beams, special fields, etc.
			These are either animations at a given point or if two points are connected then should be particle system.
		</p>
		<p>The task is to design and implement a particle system with the following features.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				No popping: The particle system should avoid sudden changes to not bother the player.
				It should be able to play fluid, continues animation, motion even when effects appear and disappear at
				any time, or start from 50% if they just got into the view.
			</li>
			<li>Scalable: The particle system should have a global parameter to specify particle density to support low
				power clients.
			</li>
			<li>Support moving and stationary emitters</li>
			<li>Optional: Occlusion detection and repression (stronger particle can hide weaker underneath and as such
				can be omitted from draw calls)
			</li>
			<li>Optional: Occlusion detection with animation subsystem</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Network Lag Compensation</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">Programming - JavaScript (TypeScript)</p>
		<p>
			The game server sends one packet every 200 ms. The network latency and lag makes this between 0 and 1000 as
			observed by the client.
			The task is to compensate this with the movement of objects so they do not jump around.
			At the moment a simple PID controller does the job quite well but it is not flawless.
		</p>
		<p>The task is to design and implement a controller to move objects on the screen with the following
			features.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Objects should not teleport or lag behind;</li>
			<li>Objects should be as close (distance) to their server sent position as possible;</li>
			<li>Objects should be as close (in time) to real time as possible - should be as responsive as possible;
			</li>
			<li>Implement a measurement system to evaluate diffrent algorithms and parameters;</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>User Interface, HUD</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">Graphics and Design</p>
		<p>The game has a very basic UI which badly needs a better design.</p>
		<p>The task is to design and draw a new User Interface for the game with the following features.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Support PCs and big monitors (full featured);</li>
			<li>Support tablets and smaller laptops (might be full featured but can omit certain UI elements);</li>
			<li>Support phones in landscape mode (limited features);</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="task graphics-task">
		<h2>Game Objects</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">Graphics and Design</p>
		<p>The game has barely any graphics for objects. We have approx 20 spaceships, asteroids, missiles.</p>
		<p>The task is to design and draw all/some game objects with the following features.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>3D looking, 2D rendered images;</li>
			<li>On a 100 dpi monitor the small spaceships are around 30 pixels</li>
			<li>Support for high DPI screens;</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Bots (AI)</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">Programming - C#</p>
		<p>
			The game uses bots to substitute players and give a different game play. These are server side algorithms
			that control spaceships.
		</p>
		<p>The task is to design and implement artificial intelligent (AI) controlled spaceships with the following
			features.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Limited processor time: max 100 µs (0.1 ms) run time per Update;</li>
			<li>Reasonable survivability;</li>
			<li>Should be able to move on the map to hot spots (like middle) and avoid asteroids;</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="task programming-task">
		<h2>Agents (AI)</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">Programming - JavaScript (TypeScript)</p>
		<p>
			Act as a player and use a browser or console to connect to server and drive an agent that has one goal to be
			better than players.
			Compete against other agents and players and win on the monthly competition!
		</p>
		<p>The task is to design and implement artificial intelligent (AI) controlled spaceship with the following
			features.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Processor time is only limited by client computer;</li>
			<li>Network lag applies;</li>
			<li>Can act every 200 ms;</li>
			<li>May control more than one spaceship, they are allowed to communicate;</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>WebGL 3D</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">Programming - JavaScript (TypeScript)</p>
		<p>Transform the game into 3D!</p>
		<p>The task is to design and implement the rendering subsystem with the following features.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>WebGL based;</li>
			<li>Fully compatible with current protocol (implements same interface);</li>
		</ul>
